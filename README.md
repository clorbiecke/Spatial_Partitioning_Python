# Spatial_Partitioning_Python
Analyzes some 2D spatial partitioning methods.

# TODO:
- [ ] PhysicsObject must have a rect bounds for use in tree
- [ ] Quad Tree
   - [ ] create Quad Tree data structure
   - [ ] create dynamic Quad Tree
   - [ ] create lazy update Quad Tree
- [ ] Spatial Hashing
   - [ ] create Spatial Hashing data structure
- [ ] Particles
   - [ ] create particle system
      - circles
      - no lifetime
      - fixed spawn rate (random position on screen, random velocity)
   - [ ] create boundry walls
- [ ] Menu
   [ ] create menu to select spatial partitioning method and begin simulation
   [ ] create an option for avoiding duplicate collision checks or not
- [ ] Simulation
   - [ ] run a specific number of iterations
      - record number of particles in sim and time to update for each iteration
   - [ ] go to data graph 
- [ ] Data Graph
   - display graph of recorded data (x: num particles, y: time to update)
